# Accident Data Analysis

## Overview

Our project aims to address various aspects of road safety using cutting-edge technologies. Central to our approach is the implementation of a dynamic live dashboard, powered by PowerBI or Tableau, to provide real-time insights into critical road safety metrics. We utilize predictive analysis models, driven by advanced classification and recommendation algorithms, to identify black spots of accidents and predict future grey spots. Additionally, our system analyzes the date, time, and location of accidents to predict their probability and pinpoint potential accident hotspots on different road types.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive analysis of contributing factors for accidents including landmarks, road signages, conditions, and pedestrian behaviors.
- Prediction of accident zones based on vehicle characteristics and profiles of accused and victims.
- Superimposition of all causative and contributing factors to build a comprehensive analysis model.
- Real-time notifications and updates on accidents, weather changes, and road conditions to enhance driver awareness.
- Computer vision technology for detecting driver behaviors like helmet and seatbelt usage.
- Chatbot offering personalized guidance on road safety practices and integrated gamified safety system incentivizing responsible driving behavior.
