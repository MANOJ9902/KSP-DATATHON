# KSP-DATATHON
Chapter-1:Identifying the Problem Statement
1.1 What made us to choose the problem statement:-
Our journey began when we had to pick a problem statement for the KSP datahon. There
were five topics to choose from:
1. Predictive Crime Analytics,
2. Traffic Flow Optimization and Congestion Management,
3. Police Performance and Resource Management,
4. Data Privacy in Law Enforcement,
5. Accident Data Analysis.
At first, we were unsure which one to select. Then, we remembered a tragic event from a
year ago when one of our friends lost his life in a road accident. Sadly, not just him, but
many young people are becoming victims of road accidents nowadays. We know the
reasons behind these accidents, but the police struggle to analyze them properly. That's
when we decided to focus on the problem statement of Accident Data Analysis.and another
reason to select this problem statement it would be easier to implement than another
problem statement as we had some knowledge regarding the predicting and the analysis
model.
1.2 Understanding the Procedure :-
The journey into understanding how accidents happen started with gathering data from
different places like police reports and hospital records. It was tough because we had to
enter all that information by hand into computers and files. Once we had all the data, we
looked at it closely to see how often accidents happened and what kinds of vehicles were
involved. Then we really got into the details: reading through each accident report to find
out what factors might have caused the accidents. We looked at things like the weather and
how people were driving. After all that work, we wrote up what we found and shared it
with the right people. Based on what we learned, we figured out ways to make the roads
safer. But it didn't stop there—we kept checking to see if our ideas were working and made
changes if they needed to. Even though the old way of doing things was hard, new ways of
looking at the data might make it easier and help keep everyone safer on the roads.
1.3 Exploration of New Technological Stacks:-
As we delved into traditional police analysis methods and sifted through data stored
in Excel sheets or manual logs, we recognized the need for innovative solutions
proposed by the Datathon team. Their analysis aims to spot accident-prone areas,
known as gray spots, considering factors like date, time, and road type. They also
aim to understand what causes multiple injuries or fatalities, including factors like
landmarks near accidents and road conditions, suggesting improvements where
needed. Moreover, they'll look into pedestrian behaviour, vehicle types, and the
demographics of those involved. By combining all these factors and traffic patterns,
they hope to improve traffic management. Ultimately, they plan to create an AI
model that predicts accidents and recommends better traffic plans. To implement
these ideas, we'll need to research technologies. For the live dashboard, we'll use
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and tools like PowerBI. For predicting accidents, we'll use
Python, TensorFlow, or PyTorch. Deployment will be handled using Docker and
Kubernetes, and for real-time notifications, we'll use Node.js and messaging queues
like Apache Kafka.
As for our journey into understanding accidents, it all began with gathering data
from police reports and hospital records. It was tough work, manually entering
everything into computers and files. Once we had all the data, we examined it closely
to see how often accidents happened and what vehicles were involved. Then we dug
deep into each accident report, looking for causes like weather and driving behavior.
After analyzing everything, we shared our findings and came up with ways to make
roads safer. But it didn't end there—we kept checking to see if our ideas worked and
made changes if needed. Even though it was hard work, new ways of looking at the
data might make it easier and keep everyone safer on the roads.
Chapter-2: -Approaching towards the Idea:-
2.1 Idea Approach: -
Our team spent a lot of time brainstorming to figure out the best and most feasible tech
stack for the solution we had in mind. It took us a whole week of discussions and debates,
but in the end, we came up with a fantastic output. We had discussions with our mentor
during this process, whose valuable input helped us navigate and refine our ideas. Their
guidance paved the way for us to choose the right path forward. We finalized a summary
of our idea, which we'll be submitting for the initial stage of the KSP Datathon. This
summary will play a crucial role in the shortlisting process, as it outlines the key aspects
of our solution and its potential impact. It was a challenging process, but we're excited
about the direction we're heading in.
The final summary of the Idea we submitted:
Combining advanced technologies and innovative approaches, our road safety solution
aims to revolutionize driver behaviour and accident prevention. Leveraging PowerBI or
Tableau, we offer a dedicated live dashboard that provides real-time insights into key
metrics related to road safety, ensuring user-friendly navigation and visually appealing
displays. Our predictive analysis model, incorporating classification and recommendation
algorithms, identifies accident hotspots and offers personalized recommendations for safer
driving practices. Real-time notifications keep drivers informed about accidents, weather
changes, and road conditions, enhancing awareness. Computer vision technology detects
driver behaviors such as seat belt usage and helmet wearing, while respecting privacy
concerns. Additionally, our integrated Gamified Safety System encourages safe driving
practices through personalized scoring, leaderboards, and competitions, fostering a culture
of responsibility and improving overall road safety awareness.
Our idea of being shortlisted was a joyful milestone for our team, validating our efforts.
Yet, it signaled only the beginning of our journey, with much work still ahead. We
celebrated our progress but remained focused on the challenges ahead, ready to continue
our efforts with determination.
Chapter-3: -Prototype development: -
3.1Challenges Faced in Implementing the Solution: -
Our journey has been a roller coaster, from finalizing our idea to being shortlisted in the
KSP Datathon. However, the real challenges arose when we delved into implementing our
solution. Developing an advanced data analysis system to identify accident patterns, highrisk locations, and contributing factors like weather, road conditions, and driver behaviour
was no small feat. Despite these hurdles, we remained undeterred. Through collaborative
brainstorming sessions and insightful discussions with our mentor, we refined our approach
and found the right path forward. These challenges served as opportunities for growth,
reinforcing our belief that nothing is impossible. With determination and perseverance, we
emerged with a refined idea, ready to tackle the complexities of enhancing road safety
measures in our community.
3.2 Development phase of the prototype: -
As our development journey continued, we carefully picked different tools to help us solve
the problem. We chose things like Power-BI for showing data, web development tools for
building the dashboard, and an LLM model for asking questions. With these tools, we
imagined making a special dashboard where we could see and understand all the data in
one place. But we didn't stop there. We wanted to make it even easier for people who might
not understand the data well, like police officers. So, we decided to add a feature where
they could ask questions and get quick answers. This step was important because it made
our project more useful for real-life situations, where people need to make decisions based
on the data they see.
3.3 Discussion regarding the prototype development
As we kept going with our project, we realized we couldn't just trust our own ideas. When
we talked to mentors and teachers, they pointed out some problems with how we were
thinking. We were only looking at things from our perspective. They said it's important to
see things from the point of view of the people who would use our solution. While
discussing it with teachers they insisted our team members go out into the field to talk to
the people we were trying to help with our accident data analysis. So, our team decided to
go out and talk to them. This way, we could understand better what they really needed and
how we could make our solution work for them.
Chapter-4 Field Hypothesis and Testing: -
4.1 Interaction in the Field (Police Department-Bommanahalli)
Once we decided to dive into fieldwork, we wasted no time. We knew that for it to be successful,
we had to immerse ourselves in the market. After completing the necessary procedures and getting
permission from the college dean and faculty members, we headed to the nearby Bommanahalli
Police Station. Upon arrival, we inquired about meeting the higher officials, but the Station
Inspector was unavailable due to a meeting. After waiting patiently for nearly an hour, we had the
opportunity to speak with Sub-Inspector ASHIF B MANIYAR. Despite his youthful appearance,
he showed keen interest in our solution and the hackathon. Although he admitted he wasn't familiar
with the KSP Datathon, he eagerly watched our demo and provided valuable feedback. As a civil
student at BMS College Bangalore, he shared insights and recommended that we meet the Station
Inspector, who had previous experience in the traffic department. Thanks to his recommendation,
we were able to arrange a meeting with the Inspector despite his busy schedule.
4.2 Interaction in the field (Police Department-Bommanahalli)
When we met Station Inspector Mr. CHANDRASEKHAR, he was nice and calm. He invited
us into his office, gave us water, and then we talked about our project. He asked why we were
there since our project was related to the traffic department, not law enforcement. But then he told
us that he used to work in the traffic department six years ago. He shared how our project could
have helped with accident awareness campaigns back then. He thought our visual data would have
been much better than the old manual way of doing things. After our discussion, Mr.
CHANDRASEKHAR recommended that we meet with some traffic department officers. He even
offered to introduce us to one of his friends working near ELECTRONIC CITY. This friend could
provide valuable insights and advice regarding our project.
4.3 Interaction in the field (Traffic Department-Electronic City)
Chandrasekhar sir connected us with Mr. SHYAM sir, an inspector at the traffic department in
Electronic City. When we met Mr SHYAM, sir, he welcomed us warmly, but he had to step out
briefly for an urgent matter. However, he arranged for one of his officers to stay and learn about
our project. While Shyam sir was away, we continued our interaction with his subordinate officer,
who remained attentive and engaged. We shared our project details and demonstrated its
functionality to the officer and the team. They were impressed by how we utilized PowerBI for
data visualization. Mr SHYAM sir provided insightful feedback, which we considered for
improving our project. He also discussed the advancements in traffic technology under the new
commissioner's leadership. After our discussion, they kindly invited us for lunch, expressing
interest in our project's progress. SHYAM Sir assured us of continued support from the
department. This marked the fruitful conclusion of our fieldwork journey.
